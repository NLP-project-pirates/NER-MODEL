NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER) IN MEDICAL TEXTS

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Medical texts such as clinical notes, research papers, and patient records contain a wealth of information. However, extracting specific information like disease names, medication names, dosages, etc., is a challenging task. The goal of this project is to develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that can accurately identify and classify named entities in medical texts.
